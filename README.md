There are some calls for the source code. 
Here is a version however I' am not sure with whether it is the final one or not, sicne the students who did the implementation are not doing research,
But I think the version can be a good paltform for the interested researchers in this field.
Kindly cite the paper:	Baochang Zhang, Wanquan Liu, Zhili Mao, Jianzhuang Liu, LinLin Shen: Cooperative and Geometric Learning Algorithm (CGLA) for path planning of UAVs with limited information. Autom. 50(3): 809-820 (2014)
